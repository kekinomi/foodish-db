# Foodish.tv  
Maintain a global database of food ingredient prices at [foodish.tv](https://foodish.tv)!  

## How to Contribute  
You can contribute by updating or adding food ingredient prices for different cities. Follow these guidelines to ensure consistency:

- **Currency:** All prices should be in **USD**, regardless of the city or country.  
- **File Structure:**  
  - Each city should have its own JSON file located in the [location](https://github.com/kekinomi/foodish-db/tree/1e2831584d082fef6199f57a6a35b911599207ab/location) directory.  
  - The JSON file should be named after the city (e.g., `toronto.json`).  
  - Use the format and structure provided in [Toronto.json](https://github.com/kekinomi/foodish-db/blob/main/location/toronto.json) as a template for all contributions.
